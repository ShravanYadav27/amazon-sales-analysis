# Amazon Sales Analysis (FY 2020–21)
# Project Summary

This is a data analysis project using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib. I analyzed Amazon sales data to understand product performance, customer behavior, and how sales are affected by category, region, and customer demographics. The project shows how raw e-commerce data can be converted into actionable business insights.

Project Objective

To clean, explore, and visualize Amazon's sales data to get insights that can support business decisions — like identifying top-selling products, high-value customers, and areas for growth.

# Key Metrics I Analyzed (KPIs)

Total Sales – Total revenue earned from all products

Average Sales – Average sales per product or category

Number of Orders – Total quantity of orders processed

Customer Segmentation (RFM) – Identifying valuable, loyal, and at-risk customers

Average Ratings – Customer ratings of products

# Charts I Created Using Matplotlib / Seaborn

Total Sales by Category – To identify best-performing product categories (Bar/Donut Chart)

Sales Trend Over Time – To analyze monthly and seasonal sales patterns (Line Chart)

RFM Customer Segmentation – Visualizing high-value, loyal, and at-risk customers (Scatter/Bar Chart)

Sales by Region / State – To see which locations contribute most to revenue (Bar/Map Chart)

Product Performance vs Discounts – Analyzing the effect of discounts on sales (Bar/Scatter Chart)

Sales by Delivery Partner & Ratings – To evaluate delivery performance (Stacked/Bar Chart)

# Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas – For data cleaning and manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn – For data visualization

Excel / PowerPoint – For the final business report and presentation
